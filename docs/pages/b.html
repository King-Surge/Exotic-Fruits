    <h1 class="home">Dragon Fruit</h1>

    <ul class="description">
        <li>The dragon fruit has a dramatic appearance, with bright red, purple or yellow-skinned varieties and prominent scales.
        <li> The fruit is oval, elliptical or pear-shaped.</li>
        <li> The flesh has a subtly flavoured sweet taste or sometimes slightly sourish taste. </li>
        <li>The flesh is either white or red, with edible black seeds dotted all over.</li>
    
    </ul>

    
    <p class="descript">The name <i style="color: gold;">'dragon fruit'</i> is derived from its unique appearance, where the spikes resemble fire and the scales resemble that of a dragon. Dragon fruit is high in vitamin C and other antioxidants, which are good for your immune system. It can boost your iron levels. Iron is important for moving oxygen through your body and giving you energy, and dragon fruit has iron. And the vitamin C in dragon fruit helps your body take in and use the iron.</p>
